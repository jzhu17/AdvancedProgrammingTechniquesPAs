-Description: The program of part 2 is designed to create four bird object classes,
a Bird interface that connects all the bird classes and an AbstractBird class 
that serves as a abstract parent class of all the bird classes. The four bird classes create
four different kinds of birds including cardinal, humming bird, blue bird and vulture. 
Each bird has different colors, positions and directions to fly. The Bird interface 
has getPosition, getColor and fly methods. I chose to have an AbstractBird class to 
avoid having to write the position field, color field, getPosition method and getColor
method repeatedly in the bird classes. What the program actually does has met the 
purpose of the design. When the program is run, a simulation of an aviary will be
created and all birds will be represented as colorful dots that move in the aviary.

  Hw#: PA3 Part 1 
  Description: The program of part1 is designed to produce four ticket classes: regular, walk-up,
advance and student advance;it's also designed to produce a test program that tests the four 
ticket classes above. The walk-up ticket class and the advance ticket class are both subclasses
of the regular ticket class, and the student advance ticket class is a subclass of the advance 
ticket class. The test program is designed to store different kinds of tickets in an array of 
tickets. It's also designed to calculate the total profits of selling the tickets and printing 
the tickets one by one. What the program actually does has met the purpose of the design and it 
does the exact things it is designed to do.

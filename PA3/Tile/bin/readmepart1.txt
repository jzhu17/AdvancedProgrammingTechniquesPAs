-Description: The program of part 2 is designed to create a TileList class that creates 
and modifies an ArrayList of Tiles objects. The TileList class has a constructor that 
constructs an ArrayList of Tiles, a moveToBack method that returns a Tile if the Tile is
inside(x,y) and moves the Tile to the back of the list, an insertBack method that inserts
a Tile at the back of the list, a size method that returns the size of the list and a get 
method that returns the Tile at the given index. What the program actually does has met the 
purpose of the design. When the program is run, the user is able to create rectangles by 
clicking and dragging to indicate the end-points. The user is also able to click on a tile 
to bring it to the top and click and drag to move a tile to a new location.
